Ultimately, 150 fractures (57.9%) were treated nonoperatively, and 109 fractures (42.1%) were treated surgically. At final follow-up, outcome measures of change in carrying angle, range of motion, and complications did not show clinically significant differences between treatment groups. Fractures without rotational deformity or coronal angulation and with a shaft-condylar angle of>15 degrees were more likely to be associated with successful nonsurgical treatment. A scoring system was developed using these features to stratify the severity of the injury. Patients with isolated extension deformity, but none of the other features, were more likely to complete successful nonoperative management."

            "Routine intraoperative frozen section (FS) of sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) can detect metastatic disease, allowing immediate axillary dissection and avoiding the need for reoperation. Routine FS is also costly, increases operative time, and is subject to false-negative results. We examined the benefit of routine intraoperative FS among the first 1000 patients at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center who had SLN biopsy for breast cancer.",
            "We performed SLN biopsy with intraoperative FS in 890 consecutive breast cancer patients, none of whom had a back-up axillary dissection planned in advance. Serial sections and immunohistochemical staining for cytokeratins were performed on all SLN that proved negative on FS. The sensitivity of FS was determined as a function of (1) tumor size and (2) volume of metastatic disease in the SLN, and the benefit of FS was defined as the avoidance of a reoperative axillary dissection.",
            "The sensitivity of FS ranged from 40% for patients with Tla to 76% for patients with T2 cancers. The volume of SLN metastasis was highly correlated with tumor size, and FS was far more effective in detecting macrometastatic disease (sensitivity 92%) than micrometastases (sensitivity 17%). The benefit of FS in avoiding reoperative axillary dissection ranged from 4% for Tla (6 of 143) to 38% for T2 (45 of 119) cancers."
        ],
        "output": "In breast cancer patients having SLN biopsy, the failure of routine intraoperative FS is largely the failure to detect micrometastatic disease. The benefit of routine intraoperative FS increases with tumor size. Routine FS may not be indicated in patients with the smallest invasive cancers.",

            "To understand which genes are really involved in the implantation process, we planned to study the gene basal expression profile during the window of implantation (WOI) of patients who became pregnant in a subsequent ICSI cycle.",
            "Women attending their first ICSI cycle at ANDROS Day Surgery for severe male factor infertility were included in the study. An endometrial biopsy was performed during the WOI, in one of the last two cycles before the ICSI cycle. Forty-seven selected gene profiles were analyzed using Low Density Array technology. Only biopsies from women who subsequently became pregnant were evaluated, to exclude any bias regarding embryo viability and embryo transfer difficulties.",
            "Fifteen patients were included in the analysis as they became pregnant after ICSI procedure. Four of 47 selected genes were excluded from the analysis. Of the 43 genes analyzed, only 6 genes (VEGFA, PLA2G2A, ALPL, LIF, NNMT and STC1) showed a statistically uniform expression among patients who subsequently became pregnant. For all the other genes analyzed there were considerable differences in their expression levels amongst women who subsequently became pregnant."
        ],
        "output": "Our data suggest that very few genes, which change their expression level during the WOI, show a quantitative homogeneous expression in endometrially-receptive patients. In conclusion, in this study only six genes showed a homogeneous expression, and are probably involved in embryo implantation mechanisms.",
