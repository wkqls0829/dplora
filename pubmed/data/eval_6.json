Rest regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) could have a strategic role in differentiating between AD patients and normal controls, but its use for this purpose has a low discriminatory capacity. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether the diagnostic sensitivity of rCBF single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) could be increased by using an episodic memory task provocation, i.e. memory-provoked rCBF-SPECT (MP-SPECT).",

            "We performed a single-center observational study that included 140 patients with HBsAg-negative CHB. Twenty-two patients, who received only NAs, discontinued treatment for different reasons and were subsequently monitored. All had normal ALT and AST, undetectable DNA and absence of cirrhosis or significant comorbidities before stopping treatment.",
            "Twelve patients showed virologic relapse (54.54%). The mean interval between discontinuation and relapse was 6.38 months (\u00b1 1.9) (75% relapsed during the first 12 months after discontinuation). Five received adefovir, 1 lamivudine and adefovir, 1 tenofovir and 5 lamivudine alone. The mean treatment duration in this group was 38.5 months (\u00b1 4.5). The sustained response group had a higher mean age and longer treatment duration than patients with virologic relapse but these differences were not statistically significant."

These patients should be closely monitored during the first year and then indefinitely.",

Imaging was requested twice as frequently in not operated admitted children (39.3%) than in the operated ones (17.5%, P<0.001). Overall complicated appendicitis rate (peritonitis and abscess) resulted 26.4% and negative appendectomy rate 8.8%.
